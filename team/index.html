                        Nathan is a junior majoring in Management Science & Engineering and minoring in Data Science. Nathan joined ASES his first quarter at Stanford and has remained involved with ASES ever since. Being the Community Co-Director last year, Nathan is a true believer that the welcoming and fun community is one of the defining features of ASES, and throughout his role as Co-President, he plans to continue actively developing this community! Outside of ASES, Nathan is involved in the Stanford Pre-Business Association, multiple IM teams, and some very spontaneous food trips with friends. As someone who loves meeting others, he is very open to having new members reach out to him at chikin@stanford.edu (the email is a bit of a long story).

                        Anwesha is a junior studying Computer Science (specifically AI) and Economics. ASES has been a major part of her undergraduate career, having joined through Bootcamp before being a member of the VC3 team and most recently the previous Recruitment Co-Director. With ASES has come some of her best memories, so she wants to pay it forward for future members to have a great experience as Co-President. She’s most recently worked at IBM Research for the Responsible and Inclusive Tech Team with an AI and NLP focus. Previously, she researched Stanford NLP group and worked at Daivergent, a startup focused on helping neurodivergent individuals find employment in the tech industry. In her free time, she loves to watch or play sports (especially basketball, soccer and American football recently), explore the outdoors, and search for new musicians to listen to.

                        Ecem is a computer science major at Stanford hoping to explore the intersection of AI and entrepreneurship and leverage its power to address social and environmental inequities. She is a former Machine Learning Engineer and Biomechatronics Researcher, and the current representative of Turkey in the World Economic Forum’s AI Youth Council. On campus, she is the Co-Summit Director at ASES, a Public Interest in Technology (PIT) Lab Frosh Fellow at Stanford PIT Lab, and an avid reader/learner in everything CS and VC! In the past 5 years, she has founded and led the non-profit Technoladies, organizing 20+ events and speaking at 20+ summits such as UN AI for Good, and reaching 500+ people. She thoroughly enjoys engaging in the broader entrepreneurial and tech communities and am really looking forward to co-directing this year’s ASES Summit with Jaston. In my free time, She likes to drink iced coffee and binge-watch Marvel series.
