                        Alex is a sophomore majoring in Computer Science. He was an active member of bootcamp and ASES
                        back in 2019, but unfortunately had to take a step back as he began serving in the Korean army.
                        With his service coming to an end, Alex is as excited as ever to finally return to Stanford, and
                        can’t wait to once again be involved with ASES! Interested in how recent breakthrough
                        technologies can be applied to real life, Alex worked in an anti-counterfeit startup last
                        summer. His hobbies include playing basketball, exploring startups, and talking about his
                        forgotten 2 years in the army.
