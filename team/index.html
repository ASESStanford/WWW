He joined ASES as a member of bootcamp last year and also served on the Summit team. This year, he will serve as the co-community director for ASES.

              Tiger is a sophomore thinking of majoring in either electrical engineering or computer science and math, but is too conflicted to declare until probably the last day of the deadline. He is interested in robotics and interned this summer at the Collaborative Haptics and Robotics in Medicine (CHARM) lab this summer, where he intends to work throughout the school year. He also wants to get more involved with artificial intelligence and machine learning since that seems to be the move right now. In his free time, Tiger enjoys demolishing everyone in his fantasy football league, playing bughouse chess, and doing wholesome activities with his friends.            </div>
